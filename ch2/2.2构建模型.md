By working with probabilities instead of raw counts, Bayesian inference is made much easier, but it looks much harder. So in this section, we follow up on the garden of forking data by presenting the conventional form of a Bayesian statistical model. The toy example we’ll use here has the anatomy of a typical statistical analysis, so it’s the style that you’ll grow accustomed to. But every piece of it can be mapped onto the garden of forking data. The logic is the same.

&emsp;&emsp;通过把原始的数值转换为概率，贝叶斯推断变容易了，但是看上去更困难一些。所以本节沿用花园路径的模式来看一下贝叶斯统计模型。示例是一个典型的统计分析，所以需要慢慢熟悉起来。但是每一部分都能在花园路径的模式中找到映射。逻辑是一样的。

Suppose you have a globe representing our planet, the Earth. This version of the world is small enough to hold in your hands. You are curious how much of the surface is covered in water. You adopt the following strategy: You will toss the globe up in the air. When you catch it, you will record whether or not the surface under your right index finger is water or land. Then you toss the globe up in the air again and repeat the procedure.41 This strategy generates a sequence of surface samples from the globe. The first nine samples might look like:

&emsp;&emsp;假设我们有一个地球的模型。这个模型可以攥在手里。现在你很好奇地球表面到底有多大面积是水。方法如下：把模型抛到空中，然后用手接住，记录下你的右手食指的地方是水还是陆地。重复此过程。最后得到一个关于地球表面的采样序列。假设前9个数据如下：

W L W W W L W L W

where W indicates water and L indicates land. So in this example you observe six W (water) observations and three L (land) observations. Call this sequence of observations the data.

W代表水，L代表陆地。所以在这个例子中，观测到6次水和3次陆地。这个观测结果就是我们的数据。

To get the logic moving, we need to make assumptions, and these assumptions constitute the model. Designing a simple Bayesian model benefits from a design loop with three steps.

(1) Data story: Motivate the model by narrating how the data might arise.
(2) Update: Educate your model by feeding it the data.
(3) Evaluate: All statistical models require supervision, leading possibly to model revi-
sion.
The next sections walk through these steps, in the context of the globe tossing evidence.

为了使模型奏效，我们还需要做一些基本的构建模型的假设。构建贝叶斯模型大约需要以下三个步骤：

1. 数据故事：通过叙述数据是怎么产生的来构想出模型
2. 更新：把数据喂给模型来训练
3. 评估：所有的统计模型都需要监督，不断修正。

下面的章节我们会通过地球模型的例子来展示这些步骤
